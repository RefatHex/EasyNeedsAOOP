# EasyNeeds by Team ReBuggers

## Executive Summary

EasyNeeds, developed by Team ReBuggers, is a comprehensive platform designed to address the challenges faced by newcomers and old residents in finding suitable homes and meal solutions in the capital city. This proposal outlines our project's objectives, features, and potential impact.

## Introduction

It might be challenging for new residents or the old residents as well of the city to locate inexpensive accommodation and quick dining alternatives. Students and Bachelors, in particular, struggle to find acceptable housing, and issues with food and meal plans affect both students and working professionals.

## Main Objective

The main goal of EasyNeeds is to make ordering food or making a daily/weekly/monthly meal plan and finding housing easier. Our goal is to offer a productive, approachable platform that lessens the challenges experienced by newcomers and old locals in these respective sectors.

## Benefits and Significance

EasyNeeds will significantly improve the lives of city dwellers by offering a one-stop solution for housing and meal needs. Our platform will reduce the stress associated with these aspects, saving time and energy for our users.

## Scope

EasyNeeds will offer a user-friendly food ordering system and the opportunity to create daily, weekly, or monthly meal plans, along with rental listings for homes and the ability for tenants to discover acceptable accommodation. Our platform will serve a wide range of users.

## Main Features of EasyNeeds

## Additional Features (Optional)

We may use some other tools as well in order to make the user interface smoother.
